Implemented most of the key parts of Michael's class/inheritance lab.

Some of the trickiest parts were getting jsHint set up.
Have intellij settings for jsHint Environment settings:  Browser, Development, Mocha

and,
/*jshint  esversion:6, globalstrict:true */
/*global assert, Account, SavingsAccount, Bank */
